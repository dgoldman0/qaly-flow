Project Impetus: The paper is highly theoretical, rapidly developed material that is exactly the kind of material that is currently viewed as being wasteful. Building an oracle vox for the paper creates a perfect test platform.

Core Paper Impetus: 

Status: The paper itself should be considered in the standard preprint stage. The oracle vox can be said to be a at the rehearsal stage.
