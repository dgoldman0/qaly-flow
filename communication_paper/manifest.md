## 1) UN Decade of Healthy Ageing: Plan of Action 2021–2030 (WHO)  
**PDF:** `WHO_2021-2030_Decade_of_Healthy_Ageing_Plan_of_Action.pdf`  
**Why this is here:** Sets the global public-health agenda for healthy ageing, emphasizing functional ability, environments, integrated care, and long-term systems change.

### Detailed summary
This plan frames healthy ageing as enabling older people to **do what they value**, and it organizes action around four areas: changing how we think/feel/act about age and ageing; ensuring communities foster older people’s abilities; delivering person-centred integrated care and primary health care responsive to older people; and providing access to long-term care when needed. It emphasizes cross-sector coordination, measurement, and a decade-long implementation horizon.

### Fit with the current framework
The framework you shared pushes readers to think beyond “one-and-done cures” toward **ongoing maintenance of health over extended horizons**. The Decade plan provides a public-health language for that shift:
- “Solving aging” becomes “sustaining functional ability” across time.
- Continuous benefit is expressed as **ongoing capability** rather than a one-time outcome.
- The plan’s decade-long time horizon naturally supports the paper’s central move: evaluate interventions by the **durable stream of healthy functioning they help generate** rather than a finite “lifetime total.”

## 2) Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) Handbook, Second Edition (WHO)  
**PDF:** `WHO_2024_ICOPE_handbook_second_edition.pdf`  
**Why this is here:** Concrete, operational guidance for delivering older-person care as a **continuum**, which maps directly to “maintenance” and long-run health production.

### Detailed summary
This handbook is a practice-oriented guide to implementing integrated care for older people, typically rooted in primary care. It includes assessment and care pathways, coordination, monitoring and follow-up, and practical steps for implementation across settings with different resources. It emphasizes person-centred goals, multidisciplinary teams, and iterative follow-up.

### Fit with the current framework
Your framework is essentially saying: if health (and potentially longevity) becomes more “renewable,” our core unit of thinking should be **the ongoing process of keeping people well**, not a one-time episode. ICOPE provides:
- A real-world blueprint for **continuous care cycles** and monitoring.
- A vocabulary (care pathways, follow-up, coordinated teams) that lets the paper describe “long-run health value” without any mathematics.
- A bridge from futuristic therapies to practical systems: even if new aging-modifying therapies arrive, they will be delivered through workflows that look like ICOPE’s continuum.

## 3) Care models for individuals with chronic multimorbidity: lessons for low- and middle-income countries (BMC Health Services Research, 2024)  
**PDF:** `Endalamaw_2024_Care_models_for_multimorbidity_BMC_HSR.pdf`  
**Why this is here:** An empirical, non-mathy synthesis showing what “durable health support” looks like in real systems—teams, settings, information systems, financing, leadership.

### Detailed summary
This paper reviews care models used for chronic multimorbidity, with attention to implementation factors and lessons for low- and middle-income settings. It describes patterns in how models are structured (who is on the team, what services are delivered, how patients are selected), and what organizational supports matter (leadership, financing, information systems). A key theme is that effective models require deliberate design of recruitment, setting, coordination, and sustained follow-up.

### Fit with the current framework
The framework’s big move is from a finite “lifetime sum” mindset to a **long-run sustainability** mindset. Multimorbidity care models provide the health-systems analog:
- When people live longer, multimorbidity is common; the “state” of health becomes something that requires **ongoing orchestration**.
- These models let the paper argue that even in a world with stronger biomedical tools, public health still must plan for **long-run care infrastructure** to maintain function and prevent cascading decline.
- The paper can use this source to ground abstract ideas in **workforce, financing, and information systems**.

## 4) Models of integrated care for multi-morbidity assessed in systematic reviews (BMC Health Services Research, 2023)  
**PDF:** `Rohwer_2023_Integrated_models_of_care_scoping_review_BMC_HSR.pdf`  
**Why this is here:** A broad map of integrated-care models and the variability of “what integrated care means,” useful for framing a public-health audience.

### Detailed summary
This paper synthesizes how integrated models of care for multimorbidity are defined and operationalized across systematic reviews. It catalogs components, contexts, and reported effects, noting heterogeneity in design and outcomes. It emphasizes primary health care as a key setting for managing chronic conditions over time.

### Fit with the current framework
This source helps the paper translate the framework into the **language of service delivery**:
- The future-facing question (“what if aging becomes manageable?”) translates into a near-term systems question: “What models reliably sustain function when chronic complexity rises?”
- It supports a claim that the public-health challenge is not merely discovering new interventions, but building **repeatable delivery patterns** that keep benefits flowing.
- It also provides a platform to discuss measurement: integrated care success needs indicators aligned with **durable functioning**, not only short-term endpoints.

## 5) A QALY is [still] a QALY is [still] a QALY?: equity and proportional shortfall (BMC Medical Ethics, 2024)  
**PDF:** `Mahdiani_2024_Equity_and_proportional_shortfall_BMC_Med_Ethics.pdf`  
**Why this is here:** If we move away from finite-lifetime thinking, equity questions intensify. This paper provides an accessible ethics/equity entry point without heavy mathematics.

### Detailed summary
This paper discusses how health systems might prioritize interventions when equity is a formal objective, focusing on “proportional shortfall” as a way to represent severity and fairness concerns. It reviews normative arguments and practical implications for priority setting, highlighting how the same quantity of health gain can be valued differently depending on severity, unmet need, and fairness objectives.

### Fit with the current framework
In a world where longevity is increasingly shaped by interventions, **who gets sustained access** becomes central:
- The framework’s “long-run” lens implies a shift from single decisions to **lifelong (or multi-decade) coverage decisions**.
- Equity criteria such as severity and shortfall help structure how public health can argue for fair allocation when benefits accrue as an **ongoing stream** (maintenance therapies, periodic rejuvenation, monitoring).
- This source lets the paper discuss equity in language public-health readers recognize: severity, fairness, priority setting—without equations.

## 6) From Life Span to Health Span: Declaring “Victory” in the Pursuit of Human Longevity (Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine, 2022)  
**PDF:** `Olshansky_2022_From_life_span_to_health_span_CSH_Perspectives.pdf`  
**Why this is here:** Provides an influential, readable framing that pivots from “live longer” toward “live healthier,” aligning with public-health goals and tempering hype.

### Detailed summary
This paper argues that major gains in human longevity have already been achieved through public health and medicine and that the priority now should be extending **health span** (years lived in good health) rather than focusing narrowly on survival. It discusses limits, trade-offs, and the importance of focusing on the quality of extended years, not just their count.

### Fit with the current framework
This source is a conceptual bridge between the paper’s long-horizon premise and mainstream public health:
- It legitimizes a narrative where “aging solved” is reframed as **health span optimized**, which is more compatible with public health’s mission.
- It helps the paper argue that the right target is a **stable, durable pattern of healthy functioning**, not an abstract endpoint.
- It offers a grounding voice that keeps futurism connected to practical goals: functional ability, burden of chronic disease, and population-level benefit.

## 7) Technical framework manuscript (your current paper)  
**PDF:** `technical_framework_current.pdf`  
**Why this is here:** This is the mathematical/theoretical foundation. The draft paper we write **treats it as background knowledge** and translates it into public-health language.

### Detailed summary
This manuscript develops a formal way to think about value and decision-making when (a) survival horizons may expand substantially, (b) risks include sudden catastrophic transitions, and (c) health can be maintained or restored repeatedly. It highlights how familiar “lifetime total” thinking becomes unstable as horizons expand, motivating a shift toward evaluating the **ongoing production and maintenance of health** over time.

### Fit with the current framework
The public-health paper treats this as the engine under the hood and uses it to justify:
- Why public health needs metrics that behave well under very long horizons.
- Why “maintenance” and “continuity” become central concepts.
- Why equity, access, and delivery systems matter more when benefits repeat over time.
