Project Impetus: The paper is highly theoretical, rapidly developed material that is exactly the kind of material that is currently viewed as being wasteful. Building an oracle vox for the paper creates a perfect test platform. Can the oracle vox help make the highly theoretical materials that are commonly produced at rapid pace with the aid of generative AI and agentic tools more valuable and thus offset the trivialization of academic papers?

Core Paper Impetus: The core of the paper is the develop and justification of a steady-flow welfare metric $J(\pi)$ for regenerative health processes; optimization and normative extensions are discussed as modular add-ons. I have long been interested in the idea of "longevity civilizations." In most science fiction, even sometimes in hard science fiction, we see "velocity civilizations:" those that have overcome the speed of light and travel across the galaxy. Longevity civilizations are far more likely. The ability to remove a hard bound on lifespan is more plausible than faster than light travel and I've thought a lot about what the future would be like if we could live for truly long spans of time. I also consider the amount of time a person is given to be far too little. And no sentient being should be bound in such a way. Meanwhile, the musings that are often done on the topic of longevity civilizations often treat them as totally alien. And the question of what kind of quality of life, or what quality of life would mean, to such beings has been raised. As we get closer to understanding aging, and as our medical technology continues to improve, it will become important to have a framework for at least understanding public health at much longer time horizons where we cannot cheat by just assuming people will live for a fixed amount of time.

Scope: 

Status: The paper itself should be considered in the standard preprint stage. The oracle vox can be said to be a at the rehearsal stage.
