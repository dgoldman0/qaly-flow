At a discount rate of one percent per year, QALYs occurring a century from now are worth only about thirty-seven percent as much as QALYs today. This still generates significant time preference. QALY flow weights all time periods equally, treating a QALY in 2124 identically to a QALY in 2024. This is a normatively distinct position, not just a limiting case of low discounting. Additionally, discounting requires selecting a discount rate, which is an arbitrary choice that significantly affects conclusions. QALY flow eliminates this parameter choice entirely, providing a cleaner criterion that does not depend on contested assumptions about how to weight time."}]}

In the limit as the discount rate approaches zero, the discounted value function goes to infinity, but the product of the discount rate and the value function converges to the QALY flow. This is the Abelian theorem connecting discounted and long-run average reward criteria in Markov decision process theory. The result shows that QALY flow is the natural limit of discounted evaluation as one becomes increasingly patient. However, the limit is singular: one cannot simply set the discount rate to zero in standard discounted formulas because the integral diverges. QALY flow handles this by using the ratio formulation from the outset."}]}

Whether this outcome is desirable depends entirely on how one values the paralyzed state relative to death.

A ten percent chance of cure yielding fifty quality-adjusted years and ninety percent chance of immediate death yields expected reward of five QALYs and expected duration of five years (roughly). The ratio depends on the baseline comparison: if the alternative is certain death soon, the risky treatment may be attractive.

To obtain Lipschitz continuity of the ratio with respect to parameters, one must bound both the rate of change of expected reward and the rate of change of expected cycle length, then combine these bounds through the quotient formula.

This matters for interpretation: the cross-sectional average quality differs from the average quality in a typical cycle unless properly weighted. The renewal-reward theorem handles this correctly by using the ratio of expected reward to expected time, which gives the time-average.
