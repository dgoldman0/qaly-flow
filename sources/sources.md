# Sources and how they ground the unbounded-lifespan policy paper

This document explains (1) what each source contributes and (2) exactly where it fits in the paper’s argument about evaluating health and social policy when there is no fixed biological lifespan.

## Sanders et al. (2016) — Second Panel recommendations for cost-effectiveness analysis
**PDF:** `pdfs/sanders2016_second_panel.pdf`

**What it is:** A canonical update to the “reference case” for cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) in health and medicine (perspectives, outcome accounting, reporting standards).

**How it applies:**
- Provides the baseline *evaluation grammar* we will explicitly generalize: how to define perspectives, count costs and outcomes, and present results.
- Helps justify why the paper can start from familiar CEA concepts (QALYs, impact inventories) and then ask what breaks (or must be reformulated) when time horizons are effectively unbounded.
- Anchors the discussion of *what a QALY-based objective is even trying to approximate* and why “reference-case” conventions exist.

## Attema, Brouwer & Claxton (2018) — Discounting in economic evaluations
**PDF:** `pdfs/attema2018_discounting.pdf`

**What it is:** A review of the central controversies and decision-theoretic motivations for discounting costs and health effects.

**How it applies:**
- Directly connects to the core technical problem in an unbounded-lifespan world: how evaluation behaves as the time horizon grows without bound.
- Supports a careful separation of:
  - *ethical/political* reasons to discount (or not),
  - *technical* reasons needed for well-defined comparisons in infinite-horizon settings.
- Helps motivate alternative foundations we consider (e.g., average-per-time reward, overtaking criteria, or declining discount rates) and which assumptions each requires.

## Gravelle et al. (2007) — Discounting and “optimal decision rules”
**PDF:** `pdfs/gravelle2006_discounting_health.pdf` (note: filename uses online publication year 2006; print year 2007)

**What it is:** A more formal treatment of discounting rules and their implications for what counts as “optimal” policy choices.

**How it applies:**
- Gives a decision-rule lens for evaluating discounting conventions.
- Useful for articulating axioms like time consistency, separability, and invariance that become load-bearing when we propose infinite-horizon alternatives.
- Helps us argue explicitly why certain discounting choices may be *structurally required* (to avoid divergence) versus merely *institutional convention*.

## O’Mahony, Newall & van Rosmalen (2015) — Time in health economic evaluation
**PDF:** `pdfs/omahony2015_dealing_with_time.pdf`

**What it is:** A practical-methodological overview of “time” issues in economic evaluation: cohort choice, how far into the future to simulate, cycle length/continuous time, and discounting.

**How it applies:**
- Bridges from standard finite-horizon practice (“simulate until nearly everyone is dead”) to the policy logic behind steady-state / limiting arguments.
- Provides a clean entry point for formalizing what we mean by “no fixed lifespan” while still having hazards, repair, and stochastic failure.
- Supports the paper’s move from *finite lifetimes + discounting* to *infinite-horizon formulations* (where horizon choice is no longer “merely practical”).

## Asaria et al. (CHE Research Paper 92) — Distributional cost-effectiveness analysis tutorial
**PDF:** `pdfs/asaria2013_dcea_tutorial.pdf`

**What it is:** A tutorial-style technical report on distributional cost-effectiveness analysis (DCEA), i.e., combining aggregate health gains with equity/inequality objectives.

**How it applies:**
- Our setting makes intergenerational and within-generation equity unavoidable: infinite horizons change who is “in the population” and for how long.
- DCEA provides a rigorous framework for stating equity axioms (e.g., inequality aversion, priority weights) rather than hand-waving about fairness.
- Helps ground sections that compare: “maximize discounted QALYs” vs “maximize equitable long-run well-being per unit time.”

## Brazier & Rowen (2011) — NICE DSU TSD 11 on alternatives to EQ-5D
**PDF:** `pdfs/nice_dsu_tsd11.pdf`

**What it is:** Guidance on when EQ-5D is inappropriate/unavailable and how to generate utility values otherwise.

**How it applies:**
- In a repair/maintenance world, “quality” becomes about chronic states, adaptation, and long-run functioning.
- This source grounds the measurement side: what assumptions are baked into utilities/QALYs, and what to do when those assumptions fail.
- Supports the paper’s claim that the technical definition of QALYs becomes more—not less—important when time horizons are huge.

## Ultsch et al. (2015) — Consensus framework for vaccine economic evaluation
**PDF:** `pdfs/ultsch2016_vaccine_econ_framework.pdf` (note: filename uses 2016; actual publication 2015)

**What it is:** A consensus framework (European vaccine economics community) focusing on immunization-specific economic evaluation issues (indirect effects, dynamic effects, discounting, etc.).

**How it applies:**
- Vaccination is one of the clearest “near neighbor” domains: herd effects, transmission dynamics, and repeated cohorts naturally invite steady-state / long-run thinking.
- Helps justify analogies we use: infinite-horizon repairable-life evaluation resembles evaluating policies in a continuing population with ongoing entry and exit.
- Provides concrete modeling and reporting norms we can adapt when discussing long-run equilibria rather than finite lives.

## Bauer, Lakdawalla & Reif (2025) — Health risk and the value of life
**PDF:** `pdfs/bauer_lakdawalla_reif_2025_health_risk_value_of_life.pdf`

**What it is:** A life-cycle valuation framework extended to *stochastic multi-state health risk*, yielding heterogeneity in the value of mortality risk reductions and QALYs.

**How it applies:**
- Our paper’s premise (“accidents/disease still happen; parts break; repairs exist”) is exactly a multi-state hazard + recovery environment.
- This provides a modern, formal grounding for why the value of longevity/health gains may be state-dependent and why a single WTP/QALY threshold can fail.
- Useful for connecting unbounded-lifespan evaluation to revealed preferences, insurance demand, and heterogeneous marginal values.

## Song, Bauer, Lakdawalla & Reif (2023) — Value of health and longevity with stochastic health risk and partial annuitization
**PDF:** `pdfs/song_bauer_lakdawalla_reif_2023_value_health_longevity.pdf`

**What it is:** A calibrated life-cycle model with stochastic health trajectories and incomplete annuitization, studying how people value improvements in health and longevity.

**How it applies:**
- Directly relevant to the socioeconomic/policy layer: pensions, annuities, savings, and the financing of long-lived populations.
- Helps formalize how “unbounded lifespan” interacts with institutional design (retirement products, insurance markets) and with the consumption path.
- Serves as a template for our paper’s sections on macro-finance constraints: long-run population health changes can reconfigure optimal insurance/transfer policies.

## Masny (2023) — Healthspan extension, completeness of life and justice
**PDF:** `pdfs/masny2023_healthspan_extension.pdf`

**What it is:** A normative argument (in *Bioethics*) defending broad access to anti-ageing / healthspan-extending technologies, framed around justice and “complete life” opportunities.

**How it applies:**
- Grounds the ethical claims that inevitably appear once “indefinite maintenance” is feasible: who gets access, what counts as sufficient opportunity, and what justice requires.
- Helps us state *normative axioms* explicitly (e.g., sufficientarian “enough opportunities” vs utilitarian aggregation) and show how conclusions depend on them.
- Provides a high-quality reference for the paper’s claim that longevity/healthspan policy is fundamentally distributive, not just technical.
