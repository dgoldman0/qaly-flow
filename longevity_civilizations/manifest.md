## `goldman2026qalyflow`

**Citation (informal):** Goldman, D.S. (2026). *Evaluating Health Policy Without a Fixed Lifespan: A Steady-State Foundation for Quality, Maintenance, and Risk*. Manuscript dated Jan 31, 2026.

**What it contributes**

- A steady-state stance for evaluating health and safety under indefinite horizons.
- A vocabulary that puts maintenance cycles and catastrophic failure risk at the center of social choice.
- A way to talk about resilience and volatility as policy-relevant, not merely descriptive.

**How it intersects the flow-first frame**

- Supplies the backbone intuition that remains valid even if the formalism changes: society should reason about sustained quality-through-time under ongoing repair, not about totals accumulated before an assumed endpoint.
- Supports “maintenance-native” institutional design: regular renewal becomes routine, and risk management becomes part of ordinary wellbeing production.
- Makes it possible to compare investments in repair capacity, risk reduction, and lived-quality improvements on a common footing.

**How we use it in the paper**

DO NOT CITE. The paper's content is assumed IMPLICITLY to be common knowledge.

## `lopezotin2023hallmarks`

**Citation (informal):** López-Otín, C., Blasco, M.A., Partridge, L., Serrano, M., & Kroemer, G. (2023). *Hallmarks of aging: An expanding universe*. *Cell*. DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2022.11.001.

**What it contributes**

- A systems map of aging mechanisms, updated to reflect the field’s expansion.
- A research framing that invites portfolio engineering across many interacting failure modes.

**How it intersects the flow-first frame**

- Makes the maintenance stack concrete: longevity is achieved by monitoring and repairing multiple coupled pathways rather than ‘solving aging’ in one stroke.
- Supports the paper’s everyday-life claim: citizens live inside an ongoing preventive and restorative program that is boring when it works.

**How we use it in the paper**

- Background plausibility for describing routine restoration without betting the paper on a single therapy.
- A bridge between biomedical engineering and societal logistics: the civilization standardizes measurements and repair pipelines.

## `simpson2021rejuvenation`

**Citation (informal):** Simpson, D.J., Olova, N.N., & Chandra, T. (2021). *Cellular reprogramming and epigenetic rejuvenation*. *Clinical Epigenetics*, 13:170. DOI: 10.1186/s13148-021-01158-7.

**What it contributes**

- A review of cellular reprogramming as a route to restoring youthful function.
- Safety and mechanistic concerns that keep rejuvenation in the engineering domain.

**How it intersects the flow-first frame**

- Illustrates how restoration can become scheduled and standardized, fitting the ‘cycle’ worldview of indefinite horizons.
- Helps motivate healthcare as a service of calibration and reset, rather than crisis response.

**How we use it in the paper**

- One exemplar technology class for the paper’s ‘personal care as maintenance’ scenes.
- A cue for why regulation focuses on long-run drift and rare failure modes, not just immediate outcomes.

**Citation (informal):** de Grey, A.D.N.J. (2004). *Escape Velocity: Why the Prospect of Extreme Human Life Extension Matters Now*. *PLOS Biology*, 2(6): e187. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020187.

**What it contributes**

- A transition narrative: incremental progress can cross a threshold where repair outruns degradation.
- A cultural argument that treats aging as a policy-relevant adversary.

**How it intersects the flow-first frame**

- Provides language for the ‘moment the horizon stopped shrinking’: planning shifts from end-focused to steady-state-focused.
- Supports early investment in measurement and repair capacity as a precondition for stable long-horizon quality.

**How we use it in the paper**

- Historical framing in the draft’s first act: why longevity civilization felt like a phase change, not a mere trend.

## `degrey2007defeat`

**Citation (informal):** de Grey, A. (2007). *Defeat of aging: utopia or foreseeable scientific reality?* Essay.

**What it contributes**

- A repair-and-maintain framing that treats organisms as maintainable systems.
- A rhetorically effective dismantling of ‘warranty-period’ thinking.

**How it intersects the flow-first frame**

- Aligns with the civilization’s central ethos: maintenance is a normal cost of continuity, not a moral failing or a late-life emergency.
- Supports the paper’s claim that a longevity society is built as much by cultural coordination as by lab breakthroughs.

**How we use it in the paper**

- Tone-setting reference for the draft’s maintenance-centered view of life.

## `olshansky2016dividend`

**Citation (informal):** Olshansky, S.J. (2016). *Articulating the Case for the Longevity Dividend*. *Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine*. DOI: 10.1101/cshperspect.a025940.

**What it contributes**

- The macro argument: extending healthy life yields broad dividends across society.
- A population-scale orientation toward healthspan rather than lifespan.

**How it intersects the flow-first frame**

- Connects individual maintenance to societal steady states: productivity, dependency, and fiscal design change when health is sustained.
- Supports long-run investment reasoning: recurring health maintenance can compound value through time.

**How we use it in the paper**

- Economic backdrop for why the civilization funds maintenance utilities and treats prevention as infrastructure.

## `stanford2022newmap`

**Citation (informal):** Stanford Center on Longevity. (2022). *The New Map of Life*. Report, April 2022.

**What it contributes**

- Institutional imagination for longer lives: learning, work, saving, community.
- A catalog of the embedded ‘lifecourse defaults’ that break under extended horizons.

**How it intersects the flow-first frame**

- Shows how continuity planning propagates beyond healthcare: housing, education, and labor markets become components of sustained wellbeing.
- Supports the paper’s social scenes: cyclical careers, lifelong learning, and redesigned retirement.

**How we use it in the paper**

- Civic scaffolding for the draft’s depiction of daily life and institutions.

## `bostrom2013existential`

**Citation (informal):** Bostrom, N. (2013). *Existential Risk Prevention as Global Priority*. *Global Policy*. DOI: 10.1111/1758-5899.12002.

**What it contributes**

- A crisp definition and taxonomy of existential risks.
- A prioritization argument for resilience as a high-leverage intervention.

**How it intersects the flow-first frame**

- Under indefinite horizons, catastrophic failure risk becomes a dominant term in any continuity-oriented welfare accounting.
- Motivates a culture of safety and redundancy as part of normal wellbeing production.

**How we use it in the paper**

- Provides a backbone for the draft’s chapters on resilience, safety culture, and continuity governance.

**What it contributes**

- A structured ethical case for giving strong weight to the far future.
- Tools for reasoning about value aggregation across time under uncertainty.

**How it intersects the flow-first frame**

- Helps justify institutional designs that remain well-behaved without assuming a terminal date.
- Supports ‘option preservation’ and reversible choice as key civic virtues.

**How we use it in the paper**

- Normative anchor for fairness across centuries, reinvention rights, and patient governance.

## `bostrom2005dragon`

**Citation (informal):** Bostrom, N. (2005). *The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant*. *Journal of Medical Ethics*, 31(5), 273–277.

**What it contributes**

- A cultural parable that reclassifies ‘natural’ mass suffering as a solvable hazard.
- A legitimacy mechanism for mobilizing resources against aging.

**How it intersects the flow-first frame**

- Explains why a maintenance civilization treats aging as a collective defense project: cultural consensus precedes durable infrastructure.
- Supports the draft’s narrative voice: a shared mythos helps stabilize long-horizon coordination.

**What it contributes**

- A practical taxonomy of metric failure under incentives.
- Mitigation patterns: metric portfolios, adversarial audits, and adaptive governance.

**How it intersects the flow-first frame**

- A measurement-rich longevity society needs metric ‘immune systems’ to resist gaming and drift over centuries.
- Supports pluralistic evaluation regimes that keep lived quality central rather than proxy-optimized.
