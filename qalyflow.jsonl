The paper provides sufficient detail to answer it with confidence.\n\nRenewal-reward theory is a branch of probability that studies processes which regenerate at random times, accumulating rewards between regenerations. The theory originated in the mid-twentieth century with foundational work by Smith, Feller, and Ross. The central result states that the long-run time-average reward equals the expected reward per cycle divided by the expected cycle length. This result is remarkably general, applying whenever cycles are independent and identically distributed with finite expectations. In the QALY flow context, each lifetime is a cycle, death is the regeneration event, and cumulative quality is the reward. The theorem justifies computing QALY flow as expected lifetime QALYs divided by expected lifespan."}]}

If you want to know the average experience per unit time over many trips, you can compute the average experience per trip and divide by the average trip duration. The same logic applies to health. Each lifetime is a trip, and accumulated quality-adjusted time is the experience. The long-run average QALY flow is expected lifetime QALYs divided by expected lifespan.

At some point, the cost of perfect health exceeds what society can or should pay, and the policy is rejected. This illustrates a fundamental insight: the framework does not say that health is priceless. It provides a structure for explicit tradeoffs, and those tradeoffs have limits. Perfect health for everyone is desirable, but if it requires infinite resources, it is not achievable and not the right policy."}]}
